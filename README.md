# PackMate
PackMate is a new generation application that we are trying to develop which helps people to plan what all things they have to take with them during the journey, according to the destination of their journey. 
The first assigned job for our application is for the camera to scan the things to be or are packed for the journey and to suggest any other items to be taken with or
any unnecessary item is packed for the destination which is going to be a waste of space for the person.
PackMate identifies and lists packed items utilizing advanced Google technologies. 
It allows the users to capture items via the app's camera. 
*Google Cloud Vision API* swiftly categorizes them. 
The app interface displays a detailed list.
*Google Material Design* ensures easy navigation.
