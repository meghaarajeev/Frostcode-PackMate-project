# PackMateðŸ’¼
<p>PackMate is a new generation application that we are trying to develop which helps people to plan what all things they have to take with them during the journey, according to the destination of their journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first assigned job for our application is for the camera to scan the things to be or are packed for the journey and to suggest any other items to be taken with or any unnecessary item is packed for the destination which is going to be a waste of space for the person.</li>
<li>PackMate identifies and lists packed items utilizing advanced Google technologies. 
It allows the users to capture items via the app's camera.</li> 
<p><li>Google Cloud Vision API swiftly categorizes them. The app interface displays a detailed list.</li>
<li>Google Material Design ensures easy navigation.</li></p>
The additional features that are implemented in this application are: 
<p><li>Travel Packing Suggestions - This feature allows to provide a rough suggestions for the journey and for the packing according to the destination place.</li>
<li>Reminders - Provides timely notifications for any schedules related to the journey.</li>
<li>CheerPack - It is and engaging section in our app that includes fun tricks and tips that would make your journey easier and would make it easy to handle the items.</li>
</p>
</ul>
                 <p> We have defined our idea and features. We are developing our app on React Native. We have developed the code for Integration of Google Cloud Vision API for our Application. Created Wireframe for our appâ€™s interface by using Figma, which is on our GitHub Repository.  
                  Looking for our next step, i.e. to implement image recognition with Google Cloud Vision API and to create a Database Setup for storing user data and packing lists.</p>
